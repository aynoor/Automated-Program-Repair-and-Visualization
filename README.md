# Automated-Program-Repair-and-Visualization
Developing an automatic program repair tool using state of the art research algorithms in fault localization and program repair to detect erroneous lines and suggest fixes. Developed heuristics based on patterns of common programming mistakes. The tool provides a thorough visualization of fault localization and program repair to better understand how the technique works and to be more effective for the programmer. Used custom C++ passes in LLVM compiler infrastructure, a C++ backend control engine, and a NodeJS frontend server.
